# Design-and-Implementation-of-an-Hotel-System-Network-Design---Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

## üìã Overview

This project aims to design and implement a secure and efficient network infrastructure for a hotel management company using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed to adhere to the principles of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)**, ensuring that the network is secure, reliable, and efficient.

Key components of the network include:

- **Local Area Network (LAN)**
- **Wide Area Network (WAN)**
- **Server Site**: Hosting DHCP, DNS, Web, and Email Servers

The network follows a hierarchical model with multiple security and performance features.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights

- **Hierarchical Network Design**: Implemented to provide redundancy and improve network efficiency.
- **Segregated Network Segments**: All departments are on separate network segments within the LAN.
- **Dual ISP Connections**: Core routers at HQ and Branch connect to two subscribed ISPs.
- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
- **Dynamic and Static IP Addressing**: DHCP servers dynamically allocate IP addresses, while server devices have static IPs.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Configured on multilayer switches to enable communication across different VLANs.
- **Routing Protocol**: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) used for advertising routes.

## üåê Network Topology

The network topology is designed as follows:

1. **Core Routers**: Each site (HQ and Branch) has one core router.
2. **Multilayer Switches**: Two at each site, configured for routing and switching.
3. **Access Switches**: Connect to each department, each with an estimated 60 users at HQ and 30 users at the Branch.
4. **Wireless Network**: Each department has its own wireless network.

## üßÆ IP Addressing and Subnetting

- **Base Network**: 192.168.100.0
- Subnetting is carried out to allocate the correct number of IP addresses to each department.
- Public IP addresses are used for internet connectivity, with the following ranges allocated to ISPs:
  - 195.136.17.0/30
  - 195.136.17.4/30
  - 195.136.17.8/30
  - 195.136.17.12/30

## üîí Security Features

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Configured to control user access and secure communication.
- **Port Security**: Implemented on server site department switches to allow only one device per port.
- **SSH Configuration**: Secure remote login configured on all routers and multilayer switches.
- **Site-to-Site VPN**: Configured using IPSec to encrypt communication between HQ and Branch.
- **Port Address Translation (PAT)**: Configured to handle outbound traffic using ACL rules.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Network Configuration

### Device Settings

- Hostnames, console passwords, enable passwords, and banner messages are configured.
- IP domain lookup is disabled for security.

### DHCP and DNS Configuration

- Dedicated DHCP servers provide dynamic IP addresses to network devices.
- DNS servers are configured to resolve domain names within the network.

### Inter-VLAN Routing

- Multilayer switches are configured to handle routing between different VLANs.

### Routing Protocols

- OSPF is configured as the routing protocol for route advertisement.
- Default static routing is used to forward traffic that does not match routing table entries.
